### Data Wrangling \/ Munging 數據管理

> “Data munging” is an unusual term used to describe the part of a data science project involving the transformation of a data set into a form more suitable for machine learning algorithms.
> 
> The task involves cleansing, converting, manipulating, parsing, filtering, and mapping data in a “raw” form into a more refined form.

花最多時間，但是 the munging process makes the data easy to model and visualize.

主要目標是 **tidy up the data.** Each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each table stores data about one kind of observation. 有哪些可能呢？參考準則如下：

* Column names should be easy to use and informative
* Row names should be easy to use and informative
* Obvious errors in the data should be repaired if possible or removed
* Values of variables should be in a consistent format \(e.g., dates in YYYYMMDD\)
* Values of variables should be consistent \(e.g., a country variable should only have one representation: US, USA, or United States\)
* Minimal missing values
* Appropriate transformed variables have been added

## 和機器學習的關係

> 特徵工程 Feature engineering: Feature engineering is the identification of the subset of data or transformed data that you want to use in your model or machine learning algorithm. Different branches of academia use different terms to describe the same thing. Statisticians use “explanatory variables,” “dependent variables,” or “predictors” when describing the subset of data that is used as input to a model. Data scientists, on the other hand, use “features.” It is quite possible that you have many redundancies or correlated variables in your raw data set, and you don’t want to include all those variables in your model. Similarly, you may wish to create new variables by transforming existing variables in some way, e.g., turning a continuous variable into a binary variable, before handing them off to the model.

> Good feature engineering involves two processes. First, you must understand the properties of the problem you’re trying to solve and how they might interact with the strengths and limitations of the algorithm you’re using. Second, experimental work in which you test your expectations and find out what actually works and what doesn’t needs to be performed. These can be done iteratively; your _top down_ understanding of the problem motivates experiments, and then the _bottom up_ information you learn from those experiments helps you obtain a better understanding of the problem. The deeper understanding of the problem can then drive more experiments. Often, feature engineering is a give-and-take process with exploratory data analysis, which we’ll see later. Feature engineering is when you use your knowledge about the data to select and create features that make machine learning algorithms work better.

### Data Pipeline

及早建立自己的資料處理管線

> I suggest that you keep all your code snippets in a central R script file or working directory. The script\(s\) will become the basis of your _data pipeline_. A data pipeline is a deterministic series of data transformation tasks that are required to take a raw data set and turn it into a transformed data set ready for machine learning. You will typically need to re-run your data pipeline over and over again to refresh your machine learning data sets with more current data. One of the characteristics of machine learning, as we’ll see in later chapters, is the need to retrain the algorithms with more current data in order to improve their predictive power.

以下是個參考，The exact order depends heavily on the data set being pre-processed and the needs of the machine learning algorithm being used.

相應於 tidy the data 處理運算如下：

* Data sampling
* Revise variable names
* Create new variables
* Discretize numeric values
* Date handling
* Binary categorical variables
* Merge data sets
* Order data sets
* Reshape data sets
* Data manipulation using dplyr
* Handle missing data
* Feature scaling
* Dimensionality reduction

  有用的套件：`plyr, dplyr, reshape2, stringr`, 以及 `lubridate`.


### Data sampling

受限於記憶體

```
# 以 iris 為例
> sample_index <-sample(1:nrow(iris), 10, replace=T)
> sample_set <- iris[sample_index,]
```

### 更改變數名稱 **_Revise Variable Names_**

不好的例子：

"employeeSalary": Mixed case name, some practitioners believe it is best to have all lower case.

"office.1": Special characters embedded in name such as the period “.” are used frequently in the R community. You may choose to eliminate all special characters.

"Country of Origin": Blank spaces in the name are not supported in R, so all embedded spaces must be removed.
"zip\_code": Use of underscore characters is common in other programming languages, and some R practitioners use them, too.

* 可以用 reshape package 中的 \`rename\(\)\`。但是注意只能修改 data frame 或者 list 的變數，（矩陣名稱要用 rownames\(\), colnames\(\) \)

```
library(reshape)
rename(dataframe, c(oldname = "newname", ...))
```

* 也可以用 \`names\(\)\` 來改，但是 不同點在於。。。。。
